In this repository, two basic IIR and FIR are implemented.
Also, under *./functions/* directory you can find implementation of some 
useful basic signals and transforms for digital signal processing.

The report *./Report_Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh.pdf/* is the reference for
the experiments and files, which is unfortunately only available in Persian language.

- **IIR Filter**: Using Butterworth approximation and Bilinear Transformation.


- **FIR Filter**: Using Kaiser window.
